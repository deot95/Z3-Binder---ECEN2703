# Z3-Binder ECEN2703

* **Click the button bellow** to access a **temporary** coding environment in which you can create and edit jupyter notebooks to test your python code. The environment has Z3 already installed so you don't have to worry about it. 

* Remember that to run the code in the jupyter notebook cells you can press SHIFT + ENTER. 

* I left the index.ipynb file with the basic Z3 import. You can use that one or create a new one, whichever you prefer.


* Don't forget to download the jupyter notebook or copy the contents of it before closing the browser tab in which it is running. **All the files edited and "saved" in the environment are temporary.**


**Disclamer:** Sometimes it takes some time to prepare the environment so please be patient. Also, if you already have installed Z3 locally, please use that one. The server can get slow if there are too many people connected.
